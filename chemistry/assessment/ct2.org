* Hydrocarbons

** Alkanes
   - less dense than water
   - Saturated hydrocarbons
   - Unreactive
*** Cracking
    - alkane --> alkene + alkane (requires catalyst and high temperature)
    - Important as bigger alkanes can be broken down to smaller alkenes and
    alkanes which can be used for more fuel

*** Alkane types
**** C1-C4
     - Gas at room temperature
     - Used as gas fuels
**** C5-C17
     - Liquid
     - Gasoline/petrol is a mixture of C5-C8
     - Motor oil, kerosene, diesel :: C9-C16
**** C18+
     - Solid
     - Paraffin wax
     - How does petroleum jelly prevent diager rash?
       - It coats the area with a protective gel layer that prevents moisture
     from getting next to skin.


*** Combustion/oxidation

\[
C_nH_{2n+2} + \frac{3n+1}{2}O_2 \xrightarrow{\textit{flame}} nCO_2 + (n+1)H_2O
\]

(requires flame)

Complete combustion (blue flame) occurs with sufficient oxygen

Incomplete combustion occurs with greater C atoms.

Soot (C particles) and CO (poisonous, odourless and colorless gas) are produced

*** Substitution reaction

\[
C_nH_{2n+2}  + X_2 \xrightarrow{UV,rtp} C_nH_{2n+1}X + HX
\]

chain reaction

requires UV light as a catalyst at rtp

Detectable acidic fumes with litmus paper. (HCl and HBr fumes are white)

** Alkenes

Low density
Alkenes with several double bonds have a color associated with them.

*** Combustion

\[
C_nH_{2n} + \frac{3n}{2}O_2 \xrightarrow{\textit{flame}} nCO_2 + nH_2O
\]
Requires heat

*** Hydrogenation/Halogenation

Alkene + Hydrogen $\rightarrow$ Alkane
Requires palladium/Platinum/Nickel + heat + pressure

Alkene + Halogen $\rightarrow$ Alkyl Halide
requires rtp

*** Polymerisation
requires heat,pressure and catalyst

** Alkynes

*** Combustion

\[
C_nH_{2n-2} + \frac{3n-1}{2}O_2 \xrightarrow{\textit{flame}} nCO_2 + (n-1)H_2O
\]

Requires heat

*** Hydrogenation/Halogenation
Alkyne + 2 Hydrogen $\rightarrow$ Alkane
Requires palladium/Platinum/Nickel + heat + pressure

Alkyne + Halogen $\rightarrow$ Alkyl Halide
Require rtp


** Aromatic

Non-polar
Volatile
Flammmable with a sooty flame
Toxic, carcinogenic (some)
substituents on benzene ring modify these properties

*** Halogenation/Hydrogenation

\[
C_nH_n + X_2 \xrightarrow{Fe/FeX_3/AlX_3} C_nH_{n-1}X + HX
\]


Requires Fe/FeX3/AlX_3


*** Alkylation (Friedal-Crafts)

Benzene + R-X $\xrightarrow{AlX_3}$ R-Benzene + HX

Requires AlX3

*** Heterocyclic aromatic compounds
Heterocyclic aromatic compunds consist of at least one atom other than carbon


* Alcohol

** Properties

*** Boiling point
Increases as we go down the homologous series of alcohols. Bp increases as the
Molecular mass increases.

*** Solubility in water
Decreases down the homologous series


** Production

*** Fermentation

\[
C_6H_{12}O_6 \xrightarrow{\textit{yeast enzymes}} 2CH_3CH_2OH + 2CO_2
\]

anaerobic

*** Hydration

alkene + water -> alcohol

\[
C_2H_4 + H_2O \xrightarrow{\textit{300\textdegree{}C, 60 to 70 atm, $H_3PO_4$}}CH_3CH_2OH
\]

reversible

** Redox

requires acidified potassium permanganate [KMnO4] (purple to decolorized )or potassium dichromate (VI) (orange to green)
[K2Cr2O7]

*** Primary alcohol

alcohol <-> aldehyde <-> carboxylic acid (+ water)

*** Secondary alcohol

alcohol <-> ketone


** Dehydration

\[
C_2H_4 + H_2O \xrightarrow{\textit{300\textdegree{}C, 60 to 70 atm, $H_3PO_4$}}_{} CH_3CH_2OH
\]

\[
CH_3CH_2OH \xrightarrow{\textit{180\textdegree{}C, excess conc. $H_2SO_4$}} C_2H_4 + H_2O
\]



* Carboxylic acid and esters

** Formation

Created via oxidation of primary alcohols

primary alcohol 2[O]-> carboxylic acid + H2O

** Characteristics of esters

   Pleasant odour, slightly polar, volatile, low molecular weight esters are water soluble

** Neutralisation

(carboxylic) acid + base -> water + salt

** Esterification

*carboxylic acid + alcohol <-> ester + water*

requires heat/reflux, excess conc. $H_2SO_4$.

carboxylic acid loses OH, alcohol loses H.

* Amines & Amides

  Primary, secondary, tertiary amines (+ Ammonia)

** Properties

   Polar, covalent, high bp and mp.

   if less than 6 carbons - soluble in water, otherwise no

   primary and secondary amines have greater bp than tertiary ones as they can have hydrogen bonding

   Alcohol has greater bp than primary/secondary amines as O-H is more polar than N-H

   primary amines have greater bp than secondary amines as presence of alkyl groups around N reduce polarity in secondary amines

** Neutralisation

when dissolved in water, they function as weak bases

RNH2 + H2O -> RNH3+ + OH-

They react with acid to form salts

RNH2 + HCl -> (RNH3)+Cl-

notice no water is formed

** Condensation reaction (Amide reaction)

   *Carboxylic acid + (primary,secondary) amine -> (secondary,tertiary) Amide + water*

   requires heat
   primary amides can be formed with ammonia

* Amides

** Properties

polar

Primary amides have high bp and mp due to strong IMF/HB

Amides with <6 C are soluble, >=6 C are insoluble in water

Neutral

* ENERGETICS

* Why add acid to water?

A large amount of heat is released when acids dissolve in water. Addition of water to acid results in a thin layer of  water on top of the acid. Heat generated in this thin layer of water can cause the water to heat up significantly and even boil, splattering acid everywhere

* Exothermic reaction

  Amount of energy released is greater than amount of energy absorbed. As a result, the temperatures of the surroundings will increase and the reaction mixture will feel warm.

  - bonds formed are stronger than the bonds broken
  - $\Delta H$ is negative
  - More energy is lost than gained in the reaction
  - Heat is given out, causing a temperate rise during the reaction
  - the products have less energy than the reactants

** Examples

Combustion
Acid + water solution



* Endothermic reaction

  Amount of energy absorbed is greater than amount of energy released. As a result, the temperatures of the surroundings will decrease and the reaction mixture will feel cold.

  - bonds broken are stronger than the bonds formed
  - $\Delta H$ is positive
  - More energy is gained than lost in the reaction
  - Heat is taken in from the surroundings, causing a temperate drop during the reaction
  - the products have more energy than the reactants


** Examples

Melting ice cube
When KBr is dissolved, the solution gets colder


* Enthalpy

"heat of reaction"

\[
\Delta H_{rxn} = H_{product} - H_{reactants}
\]

units = $kJ/mol$
