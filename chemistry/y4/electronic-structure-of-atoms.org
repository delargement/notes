* Theory

** Principal quantum number, n

Relates to the average relative distance of the electron from the nucleus or energy level

Larger n -> larger orbital & higher energy level (closer to zero)

A collection of oribtals with same n is called a principal/electron shell

** Angular momentum quantum number, l

l = 0,1,2,...,n-1
(i.e. spdf)

Describes the shape of the volume of space occupied by the electron

Defines subshell

** Magnetic quantum number, m_l

-l to l

number of m_l values indicate number of orbitals. It describes the 3-D orientation of the orbital occupied by the electron wrt an applied magnetic field.

e.g. 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z
e.g. [3d] yz, xz, xy , x^2-y^2, z^2

same m_l -> same energy (degenerate)

** Electron spin quantum number, m_s

accounts for possible orientations of the electron when magnetic field is applied

** Magnetism

*** Paramagnetism
unpaired electrons, attracted by magnets
There's net spin in at least one of its atomic orbitals

*** Diamagnetism
Slightly repelled by magnets
There is no net spin in its atomic orbitals

** Anomalous electron config

Cr = [Ar] $3d^54s^1$
Cu = [Ar] $3d^{10}4s^1$

Due to added stability associated with half-filled and completely-filled subshells

** Rules
- Hund rule: minimise spin pairs
- aufbau rule: zig zag
