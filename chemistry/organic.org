* Hydrocarbons
** Alkanes
   - less dense than water
   - Saturated hydrocarbons
   - Unreactive
*** Cracking
    - alkane --> alkene + alkane (requires catalyst)
    - Important as bigger alkanes can be broken down to smaller alkenes and alkanes which can be used for more fuel
*** Alkane types
**** C1-C4
- Gas at room temperature
- Used as gas fuels
**** C5-C17
- Liquid
- Gasoline/petrol is a mixture of C5-C8
- Motor oil, kerosene, diesel:: C9-C16
**** C17+
- Solid
- Paraffin wax
- How does petroleum jelly prevent diager rash?
- It  coats the area with a protective gel layer that prevents moisture from getting next to skin.
*** Combustion/oxidation

\[
C_nH_{2n+2} + \frac{3n+1}{2}O_2 \xrightarrow{\textit{flame}} nCO_2 + (n+1)H_2O
\]

(requires flame)

Complete combustion (blue flame) occurs with sufficient oxygen

Incomplete combustion occurs with greater C atoms

Soot (C particles) and CO (poisonous, odourless and colorless gas) are produced

*** Substitution reaction

\[
C_nH_{2n+2}  + X_2 \xrightarrow{UV,rtp} C_nH_{2n+1}X + HX
\]

Chain reaction

Requires UV light as a catalyst at rtp

Detectable acidic fumes with litmus paper. (HCl and HBr fumes are white)

** Alkenes

Low density

Alkenes with several double bonds have a color associated with them.

*** Combustion
\[
C_nH_{2n} + \frac{3n}{2}O_2 \xrightarrow{\textit{flame}} nCO_2 + nH_2O
\]

Requires heat

*** Hydrogenation/Halogenation

Alkene + Hydrogen $\rightarrow$ Alkane
Requires palladium/Platinum/Nickel + heat + pressure

Alkene + Halogen $\rightarrow$ Alkyl Halide
requires rtp

*** Polymerisation
requires heat,pressure and catalyst

** Alkynes
*** Combustion
\[
C_nH_{2n-2} + \frac{3n-1}{2}O_2 \xrightarrow{\textit{flame}} nCO_2 + (n-1)H_2O
\]
Requires heat

*** Hydrogenation/Halogenation
Alkyne + 2 Hydrogen $\rightarrow$ Alkane
Requires palladium/Platinum/Nickel + heat + pressure

Alkyne + Halogen $\rightarrow$ Alkyl Halide
Require rtp

** Aromatic

Non-polar
Volatile
Flammmable with a sooty flame
Toxic, carcinogenic (some)
Substituents on benzene ring modify these properties

*** Halogenation/Hydrogenation

\[
C_nH_n + X_2 \xrightarrow{Fe/FeX_3/AlX_3} C_nH_{n-1}X + HX
\]

Requires Fe/FeX3/AlX_3

*** Alkylation (Friedal-Crafts)

Benzene + R-X $\xrightarrow{AlX_3}$ R-Benzene + HX

Requires AlX3

*** Heterocyclic aromatic compounds

Heterocyclic aromatic compunds consist of at least one atom other than carbon

* Alcohol

** Properties
*** Boiling point

Increases as we go down the homologous series of alcohols. Bp increases as the molecular mass increases.

*** Solubility in water

Decreases down the homologous series.

** Production
*** Fermentation


\[
C_6H_{12}O_6 \xrightarrow{\textit{yeast enzymes}} 2CH_3CH_2OH + 2CO_2
\]

anaerobic

*** Hydration

alkene + water -> alcohol

\[
C_2H_4 + H_2O \xrightarrow{\textit{300\textdegree{}C, 60 to 70 atm, $H_3PO_4$}} CH_3CH_2OH
\]

reversible

** Redox

requires acidified potassium permanganate [KMnO4] (purple to decolorized) or potassium dichromate (VI) (orange to green)
[K2Cr2O7]

** Dehydration
\[
C_2H_4 + H_2O \xrightarrow{\textit{300\textdegree{}C, 60 to 70 atm, $H_3PO_4$}} CH_3CH_2OH
\]

\[
CH_3CH_2OH \xrightarrow{\textit{180\textdegree{}C, excess conc. $H_2SO_4$}} C_2H_4 + H_2O
\]

* Carboxylic acid
** Formation

Created via oxidation of primary alcohols

primary alcohol 2[O]-> carboxylic acid + H2O

** Characteristics

Pleasant odour, slightly polar, volatile, low molecular weight esters are water soluble

** Neutralisation

(carboxylic) acid + base -> water + salt

(carboxylic) acid + water -> carboxlylate + hydronium
(reversible)

** Esterification

*carboxylic acid + alcohol -> ester + water*

requires heat/reflux, conc. $H_2SO_4$.

carboxylic acid loses OH, alcohol loses H.

* Amines & Amides

  Primary, secondary, tertiary amines (+ Ammonia)

** Properties

Polar, covalent, high bp and mp.

if less than 6 carbons - soluble in water, otherwise no

primary and secondary amines have greater bp than tertiary ones as they can have hydrogen bonding

Alcohol has greater bp than primary/secondary amines as O-H is more polar than N-H

primary amines have greater bp than secondary amines as presence of alkyl groups around N reduce polarity in secondary amines

** Neutralisation

when dissolved in water, they function as weak bases

RNH2 + H2O -> RNH3+ + OH-

They react with acid to form salts

RNH2 + HCl -> (RNH3)+Cl-

notice no water is formed

** Condensation reaction (Amide reaction)

*Carboxylic acid + (primary,secondary) amine -> (secondary,tertiary) Amide + water*

requires heat
primary amides can be formed with ammonia

* Amides

** Properties

polar

Primary amides have high bp and mp due to strong IMF/HB

Amides with <6 C are soluble, >=6 C are insoluble in water

Neutral
