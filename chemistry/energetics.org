* Why add acid to water?

A large amount of heat is released when acids dissolve in water. Addition of water to acid results in a thin layer of water on top of the acid. Heat generated in this thin layer of water can cause the water to heat up significantly and even boil, splattering acid everywhere

* Exothermic reaction

Amount of energy released is greater than amount of energy absorbed. As a result, the temperatures of the surroundings will increase and the reaction mixture will feel warm.

- bonds formed are stronger than the bonds broken
- $\Delta H$ is negative
- More energy is lost than gained in the reaction
- Heat is given out, causing a temperate rise during the reaction
- the products have less energy than the reactants

** Examples
Combustion
Acid + water solution

* Endothermic reaction

Amount of energy absorbed is greater than amount of energy released. As a result, the temperatures of the surroundings will decrease and the reaction mixture will feel cold.

bonds broken are stronger than the bonds formed
$\Delta H$ is positive
More energy is gained than lost in the reaction
Heat is taken in from the surroundings, causing a temperate drop during the reaction
The products have more energy than the reactants

** Examples
Melting ice cube
When KBr is dissolved, the solution gets colder

* Factors

Catalysts provide an alternate pathway with lower activation energy.

More heat -> more KE.

The number of molecules with energy greater than activation energy increases, leading to more collisions.

* Enthalpy

"heat of reaction"

\[
\Delta H_{rxn} = H_{product} - H_{reactants}
\]

units = $kJ/mol$
