* Definitions

Standard form:

minimise $\bm{c^T x}$,
subject to $A\bm{x} = \bm{b}$
$\bm{x} \geq \bm{0}$


A problems can be converted to another problem by applying the following operations:

- Elimination of free variables:
Given an unrestricted variable $x_j$ we replace it with $x_j^+ - x_j^-$ which are both non-negative.
- Elimination of inequality constraints:

Given $\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j \leq b_i$,

we introduce a new *slack* variable $s_i \geq 0$:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j + s_i = b_i
\]

the opposite is treated with a *surplus* variable $s_i \geq 0$ but replace '+ s_i' with '- s_i'

** Piecewise linear convex objective problems

A function $f : \mathcal{R}^n \mapsto \mathcal{R}$, is called convex if for every $\bm{x},\bm{y} \in \mathcal{R}^n$, and every $\lambda \in [0,1]$, we have:

\[
f(\lambda\bm{x} + (1-\lambda)\bm{y}) \leq \lambda f(\bm{x}) + (1-\lambda)f(\bm{y})
\]

A concave function is defined similarly but inverse.

=Note relation between local and global minima/maxima due to this property.=


*Theorem*

Let $f_1,\cdots,f_m : \mathcal{R}^n \mapsto \mathcal{R}$ be convex functions. Then the function $f$ defined by
$f(\bm{x}) = \max_{i=1,\ldots,m}f_i(\bm{x})$ is also convex.

*Transformation*

"minimize $\max_i (\bm{c}_i^T \bm{x} + d_i)$, subject to $Ax \geq b$"

can become:

"minimize z, subject to $z\geq \bm{c}_i^T \bm{x} + d_i$ for all i, Ax >= b"


When modulus appears:

minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i |x_i|$

subject to $Ax\geq b$
where the coefficients are nonnegative such that the function is convex.

becomes:

minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n c_iz_i$

subject to $Ax \geq b, x_i \leq z_i, -x_i\leq z_i$

*or*

minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i(x^+_i + x^-_i)$

subject to $Ax^+ - Ax^- \geq b, x^+,x^- \geq 0$.

Notice that $x^+_i = 0$ or $x^-_i = 0$.

** Dynamical systems

\[
\bm{x}(t+1) = \bm{Ax}(t) + \bm{Bu}(t)
\]

where we are free to choose u(t) subject to Du(t) <= d.

\[
y(t) = \bm{c}^T\bm{x}(t)
\]

*possible form*

minimize z
subject to -z <= y(t) <=  z
x(t+1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)
y(t) = c'x(t)
Du(t) <= d
x(T) = 0,
x(0) = given,

** Possible outcomes

- There exists a unique optimal solution
- There exist multiple optimal solutions; in this case, the set of optimal solutions can be either bounded or unbounded
- The optimal cost -infty, and no feasible solution is optimal
- The feasible set is empty
- there is also "minimize 1/x subject to x>0" but it does not arise in linear programming

* Geometry

** Polyhedron

*Definition*
A polyhedron is a set that can be described in the form $\{\bm{x} \in \mathcal{R}^n \vert \bm{Ax}\geq \bm{b}\}$, where A is an m x n matrix and b is a vector in $\mathcal{R}^m$


*Definition*

Let $\bm{a}$ be a nonzero vector in $\mathcal{R}^n$, and let b be a scalar.

1. The set $\{\bm{x} \in \mathcal{R}^n \vert \bm{a}'\bm{x} = \bm{b}\}$ is called a hyperplane
2. The set $\{\bm{x} \in \mathcal{R}^n \vert \bm{a}'\bm{x} \geq \bm{b}\}$ is called a halfspace.

Note that a hyperplane is the boundary of a corresponding halfspace. The vector $\bm{a}$, is perpendicular to the hyperplane. (note that a is the normal of the hyperplane. In a way, b is the distance of the hyperplane from the origin)

*Definition*

A set $S \subset \mathcal{R}^n$ is convex if for any $\bm{x},\bm{y} \in S$, and any $\lambda \in [0,1]$, we have $\lambda \bm{x} + (1-\lambda)\bm{y} \in S$. Notice that the expression is a weighted average of x,y.

*Definition*

Let $x^1,\ldots,x^k$ be vectors in $\mathcal{R}^n$ and let $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k$ be nonnegative scalars whose sum is unity.

The vector $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i\bm{x}^i$, is said to be a *convex combination* of the vectors $x^1,\ldots,x^k$

The *convex hull*, of the vectors $x^1,\ldots,x^k$ is the set of all convex combinations of these vectors.

*Theorem*

1. The intersection of convex sets is convex.
2. Every polyhedron is a convex set
3. A convex combinations of a finite number of elements of a convex set also belongs to that set.
4. The convex hull of a finite number of vectors is a convex set.


** Corners

*Definition*

Let P be a polyhedron. A vector $x \in P$ is an *extreme-point* of P if we cannot find two vectors y,z in P both different from x and a scalar $\lambda \in [0,1]$ such that $x = \lambda y + (1-\lambda)z$.

*Definition*

Let P be a polyhedron. A vector $x \in P$ is a *vertex* of P if there exists some $c$ such that $c'x < c'y$ for all $y \in P$, $y \neq x$.
