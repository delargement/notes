* Real numbers

*Theorem*

There exists an ordered field R which has the least-upper-bound property. R contains Q as a subfield


*Theorem*
If $x \in R$, $y \in R$, and $x > 0$, then there's a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$.
If $x < y$, then there exists a $p \in Q$ such that $x < p < y$

*Theorem*

For every positive real x and every positive integer n, there is only one positive real y such that $y^n = x$
