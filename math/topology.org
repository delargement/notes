* Set theory

** Inverse functions

If f : A -> B,

\[
f^{-1}(B_0) = \{a \vert f(a) \in B_0\}
\]


** Relations

*** Equivalence relations

If there is a equivalence relation C on A it has the following properties,

1. Reflexivity: xCx for every x in A.
2. Symmetry: if xCy, then yCx.
3. Transitivity: if xCy and yCz, then xCz.

A *equivalence class* determined by x is given by:

\[
E = \{y \vert y \sim x\}
\]

*Lemma*: Two equivalence classes E and E' are either disjoint or equal.

*Partition*: Collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of A whose union is all of A.

Note that given any partition of A, there is exactly one equivalence relation from which it is derived.

*Example*: Define two points in the plane to be equivalent is they lie at the same distance from the origin. Then it is a equivalence relation and the collection of equivalence classes consists of all circles centered at the origin, along with the origin alone.


*** Order relation

1. (Comparability) For every x and y in A for which x != y, either xCy or yCx.
2. (Nonreflexivity) For no x in A does the relation xCx hold.
3. (Transitivity) If xCy and yCz, then xCz.


(a,b) is then the set {x | a < x < b}, which is an open interval. If the set is empty, a (b) is the immediate predecessor (sucessor) of b (a).

*Order type*: A and B have the same order type if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order.

*Dictionary order*: A "lexicographic" order relation for cartesian products.

*Least upper bound property*: An ordered set A has the lub property if every nonempty subset A_0 of A that is bounded above has a least upper bound. The greatest lowerbound property is defined similarly.

*** Size of set

1. A is finite if $A \sim J_n$ for some n, where $J_n$ is the set whose elements are the integers 1 to n.
2. A is infinite if A is not finite/ A is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.
3. A is countable if $A \sim J$
4. A is uncountable if A is neither finite nor countable
5. A is at most countable if A is finite or countable

*Corollaries*:

- Set of all integers is countable
*Proof*: The set of all integers is countable as we can set up a 1-1 correspondence: $f(n) = n/2$ when n is even, and $f(n) = - (n-1)/2$ when n is odd.

- Every infinite subset of a countable set A is countable

- The union of a sequence of countable sets is countable: Cantor diagonalisation

- If $A$ is a countable set, and $B_n$ is the set of all n-tuples $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, where $a_k \in A (k = 1,\ldots,n)$ and the elements $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ need not be distinct. Then $B_n$ is countable

*Theorem*

The set of all sequences whose elements are the digits 0 and 1 is uncountable.

** Metric Spaces

A set X, whose elements we shall call points, is said to be a metric space if any two points p,q of X there is associated a real number d(p,q), such that

1. $d(p,q) > 0$, if $p \neq q$; $d(p,p) = 0;
2. $d(p,q) = d(q,p)$
3. $d(p,q) \leq d(p,r) + d(r,q)$ for any $r \in X$

Any function with these properties is called a *distance function* or *metric*.

*Definition*

If  $a_i < b_i$ for all i, then the set of points in euclidean space that satisfies the inequality $a_i \leq x_i \leq b_i$ for all i is called a *k-cell*.

If $x \in R^k$ and $r > 0$, the *open* or *closed ball* B, with center at x and radius r is defined to be the set of all $y \in R^k$ such that $\vert y - x \vert < r$ or likewise for closed balls.

A set $E \subset R^k$ is *convex* if $\lambda \bm{x} + (1-\lambda)\bm{y} \in E$, where $\bm{x},\bm{y} \in E$ and $0 < \lambda < 1$.


*Definition*

1. A *neighbourhood* of p is a set $N_r(p)$ consisting of all q such that $d(p,q) < r$, for some $r > 0$. r is the *radius* of $N_r(p)$.
2. A point p is a *limit point* of the set E if /every/ neighbourhood of p contains a point $q \neq p$ such that $q \in E$.
3. If $p \in E$ and p is not a limit point of E, then p is called an *isolated point* of E.
4. E is *closed* if every limit point of E is a point of E.
5. A point p is an *interior* point of E if there is a neighbourhood N of p such that $N \subset E$.
6. E is *open* if every point of E is an interior point of E.
7. The *complement* of E (denoted by $E^c$) is the set of all points $p \in X$ such that $p \notin E$
8. E is *perfect* if E is closed and every point of E is a limit point of E. i.e. a point is a limit point of E iff $p \in E$.
9. E is *bounded* if there is a real number M and a point $q \in X$ such that $d(p,q) < M \forall p \in E$.
10. E is *dense* in X if every point of X is a limit point of E, or a point of E or both.

*Theorem*

Every neighbourhood is an open set.

*Theorem*

If p is a limit point of a set E, then every neighbourhood of p contains infinitely many point of E.

*Corollary*

A finite point set has no limit points.

*Theorem*

Let $\left{E_\alpha \right}$ be a collection of sets. Then

\[
\left(\bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha \right)^c = \bigcap_\alpha (E_\alpha^c)
\]


*Theorem*

A set is open iff its complement is closed

A set F is closed iff its complement is open.

*Theorem*

1. For any collection of open sets, $\{G_\alpha\}$, $\cup_\alpha G_\alpha$ is open.
2. For any collection of closed sets, $\{F_\alpha\}$, $\cap_\alpha G_\alpha$ is closed.
3. For any finite collection of open sets, $\cap_i G_i$ is open.
4. For any finite collection of closed sets, $\cup_i F_i$ is closed.


*Definition*

If X is a metric space, E is a subset of X and if E' is the set of limit points of E in X, then the *closure* of E is the set $\bar{E} = E \cup E'$.
in
*Theorem*

1. $\bar{E}$ is closed.
2. $E = \bar{E}$ iff E is closed.
3. $\bar{E} \subset F$ for every closed set $F \subset X$ such that $E \subset F$.


*Theorem*
Let E be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above. Let $y = \sup E$, then $y \in \bar{E}$. Hence, $y \in E$ if E is closed.

*Theorem*

Suppose $Y \subset X$. A subset E of Y is open relative to Y iff $E = Y \cap G$ for some open subset G of X.

** Compact sets

*Definition*

An *open cover* of a set E in a metric space X, we mean a collection of open subsets of X such that $E \subset \cup_\alpha G_\alpha$.

*Definition*

A subset K of of a metric space X is said to be *compact* if every open cover of K contains a subcover. i.e. if $\left\{G_\alpha \right\}$ is an open cover of K, then there are finitely many indices $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$, such that:

\[
K \subset G_{\alpha_1} \cup \ldots \cup G_{\alpha_n}
\]

*Theorem*

Suppose $K \subset Y \subset X$. Then K is compact relative to X iff K is compact relative to Y.


*Theorem*

Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed.

*Theorem*

Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.
*Corollary*: If F is closed and K is compact, then $F \cap K$ is compact.

*Theorem*

If $\{K_\alpha\}$ is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space X such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of $\{\K_alpha\}$ is non-empty, then $\cap K_\alpha$ is nonempty.
*Corollary*: If $\{K_n\}$ is a sequence of nonempty compact sets such that $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$ then $\cap_1^\infty K_n$ is not empty.

*Theorem*
If E is an infinite subset of a compact set K, then E has a limit point in K.

*Theorem*
If $\{I_n\}$ is a sequence of intervals in $R^1$, such that $I_n \supset I_{n+1}$ then $\cap^\infty_1 I_n$ is not empty.

*Theorem*
If $\{I_n\}$ is sequence of k-cells such that $I_n \superset I_{n+1}$, then $\cap^\infty_1 I_n$ is not empty.

*Theorem*
Every k-cell is compact.

*Theorem*
If a set in $R^k$ has one of the following three properties, it has the other two.

1. E is closed and bounded
2. E is compact
3. Every infinite subset of E has a limit point in E.

   (b) and (c) are equivalent in any metric space but (a) does not in general imply (b) and (c).

*Theorem (Weierstrass)*

Every bounded infinite subset of $R^k$ has a limit point in $R^k$.

** Perfect sets

*Theorem*

A nonempty perfect set in $R^k$ is uncountable.

** Connected sets

Two subsets A,B of a metric space X are /seperated/ if $A \cap \bar{B}$ and $\bar{A}\cap B$ are empty. A subset of X is connected if it is not a union of two nonempty seperated sets.

*Theorem*

A subset E of the real line $R^1$ is connected iff it has the following property: If $x,y \in E$, $x < z < y$, then $z \in E$.
