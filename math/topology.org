* Set theory

** Inverse functions

If f : A -> B,

\[
f^{-1}(B_0) = \{a \vert f(a) \in B_0\}
\]


** Relations

*** Equivalence relations

If there is a equivalence relation C on A it has the following properties,

1. Reflexivity: xCx for every x in A.
2. Symmetry: if xCy, then yCx.
3. Transitivity: if xCy and yCz, then xCz.

A *equivalence class* determined by x is given by:

\[
E = \{y \vert y \sim x\}
\]

*Lemma*: Two equivalence classes E and E' are either disjoint or equal.

*Partition*: Collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of A whose union is all of A.

Note that given any partition of A, there is exactly one equivalence relation from which it is derived.

*Example*: Define two points in the plane to be equivalent is they lie at the same distance from the origin. Then it is a equivalence relation and the collection of equivalence classes consists of all circles centered at the origin, along with the origin alone.


*** Order relation

1. (Comparability) For every x and y in A for which x != y, either xCy or yCx.
2. (Nonreflexivity) For no x in A does the relation xCx hold.
3. (Transitivity) If xCy and yCz, then xCz.


(a,b) is then the set {x | a < x < b}, which is an open interval. If the set is empty, a (b) is the immediate predecessor (sucessor) of b (a).

*Order type*: A and B have the same order type if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order.

*Dictionary order*: A "lexicographic" order relation for cartesian products.

*Least upper bound property*: An ordered set A has the lub property if every nonempty subset A_0 of A that is bounded above has a least upper bound. The greatest lowerbound property is defined similarly.

*** Size of set

1. A is finite if $A \sim J_n$ for some n, where $J_n$ is the set whose elements are the integers 1 to n.
2. A is infinite if A is not finite/ A is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.
3. A is countable if $A \sim J$
4. A is uncountable if A is neither finite nor countable
5. A is at most countable if A is finite or countable

*Corollaries*:

- Set of all integers is countable
*Proof*: The set of all integers is countable as we can set up a 1-1 correspondence: $f(n) = n/2$ when n is even, and $f(n) = - (n-1)/2$ when n is odd.

- Every infinite subset of a countable set A is countable

- The union of a sequence of countable sets is countable: Cantor diagonalisation

- If $A$ is a countable set, and $B_n$ is the set of all n-tuples $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, where $a_k \in A (k = 1,\ldots,n)$ and the elements $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ need not be distinct. Then $B_n$ is countable
