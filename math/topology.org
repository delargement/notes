* Set theory

** Inverse functions

If f : A -> B,

\[
f^{-1}(B_0) = \{a \vert f(a) \in B_0\}
\]


** Relations

*** Equivalence relations

If there is a equivalence relation C on A it has the following properties,

1. Reflexivity: xCx for every x in A.
2. Symmetry: if xCy, then yCx.
3. Transitivity: if xCy and yCz, then xCz.

A *equivalence class* determined by x is given by:

\[
E = \{y \vert y \sim x\}
\]

*Lemma*: Two equivalence classes E and E' are either disjoint or equal.

*Partition*: Collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of A whose union is all of A.

Note that given any partition of A, there is exactly one equivalence relatoin from which it is derived.

*Example*: Define two points in the plane to be equivalent is they lie at the same distance from the origin. Then it is a equivalence relation and the collection of equivalence classes consists of all circles centered at the origin, along with the origin alone.

*** Order relation

1. (Comparability) For every x and y in A for which x != y, either xCy or yCx.
2. (Nonreflexivity) For no x in A does the relation xCx hold.
3. (Transitivity) If xCy and yCz, then xCz.


(a,b) is then the set {x | a < x < b}, which is an open interval. If the set is empty, a (b) is the immediate predecessor (sucessor) of b (a).

*Order type*: A and B have the same order type if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order.

*Dictionary order*: A "lexicographic" order relation for cartesian products.

*Least upper bound property*: An ordered set A has the lub property if every nonempty subset A_0 of A that is bounded above has a least upper bound. The greatest lowerbound property is defined similarly.
