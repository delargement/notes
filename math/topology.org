* Set theory

** Inverse functions

If f : A -> B,

\[
f^{-1}(B_0) = \{a \vert f(a) \in B_0\}
\]


** Relations

*** Equivalence relations

If there is a equivalence relation C on A it has the following properties,

1. Reflexivity: xCx for every x in A.
2. Symmetry: if xCy, then yCx.
3. Transitivity: if xCy and yCz, then xCz.

A *equivalence class* determined by x is given by:

\[
E = \{y \vert y \sim x\}
\]

*Lemma*: Two equivalence classes E and E' are either disjoint or equal.

*Partition*: Collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of A whose union is all of A.

Note that given any partition of A, there is exactly one equivalence relation from which it is derived.

*Example*: Define two points in the plane to be equivalent is they lie at the same distance from the origin. Then it is a equivalence relation and the collection of equivalence classes consists of all circles centered at the origin, along with the origin alone.


*** Order relation

1. (Comparability) For every x and y in A for which x != y, either xCy or yCx.
2. (Nonreflexivity) For no x in A does the relation xCx hold.
3. (Transitivity) If xCy and yCz, then xCz.


(a,b) is then the set {x | a < x < b}, which is an open interval. If the set is empty, a (b) is the immediate predecessor (sucessor) of b (a).

*Order type*: A and B have the same order type if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order.

*Dictionary order*: A "lexicographic" order relation for cartesian products.

*Least upper bound property*: An ordered set A has the lub property if every nonempty subset A_0 of A that is bounded above has a least upper bound. The greatest lowerbound property is defined similarly.

*** Size of set

1. A is finite if $A \sim J_n$ for some n, where $J_n$ is the set whose elements are the integers 1 to n.
2. A is infinite if A is not finite/ A is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.
3. A is countable if $A \sim J$
4. A is uncountable if A is neither finite nor countable
5. A is at most countable if A is finite or countable

*Corollaries*:

- Set of all integers is countable
*Proof*: The set of all integers is countable as we can set up a 1-1 correspondence: $f(n) = n/2$ when n is even, and $f(n) = - (n-1)/2$ when n is odd.

- Every infinite subset of a countable set A is countable

- The union of a sequence of countable sets is countable: Cantor diagonalisation

- If $A$ is a countable set, and $B_n$ is the set of all n-tuples $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, where $a_k \in A (k = 1,\ldots,n)$ and the elements $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ need not be distinct. Then $B_n$ is countable

*Theorem*

The set of all sequences whose elements are the digits 0 and 1 is uncountable.

** Metric Spaces

A set X, whose elements we shall call points, is said to be a metric space if any two points p,q of X there is associated a real number d(p,q), such that

1. $d(p,q) > 0$, if $p \neq q$; $d(p,p) = 0$;
2. $d(p,q) = d(q,p)$
3. $d(p,q) \leq d(p,r) + d(r,q)$ for any $r \in X$

Any function with these properties is called a *distance function* or *metric*.

*Definition*

If  $a_i < b_i$ for all i, then the set of points in euclidean space that satisfies the inequality $a_i \leq x_i \leq b_i$ for all i is called a *k-cell*.

If $x \in R^k$ and $r > 0$, the *open* or *closed ball* B, with center at x and radius r is defined to be the set of all $y \in R^k$ such that $\vert y - x \vert < r$ or likewise for closed balls.

A set $E \subset R^k$ is *convex* if $\lambda \bm{x} + (1-\lambda)\bm{y} \in E$, where $\bm{x},\bm{y} \in E$ and $0 < \lambda < 1$.


*Definition*

1. A *neighbourhood* of p is a set $N_r(p)$ consisting of all q such that $d(p,q) < r$, for some $r > 0$. r is the *radius* of $N_r(p)$.
2. A point p is a *limit point* of the set E if /every/ neighbourhood of p contains a point $q \neq p$ such that $q \in E$.
3. If $p \in E$ and p is not a limit point of E, then p is called an *isolated point* of E.
4. E is *closed* if every limit point of E is a point of E.
5. A point p is an *interior* point of E if there is a neighbourhood N of p such that $N \subset E$.
6. E is *open* if every point of E is an interior point of E.
7. The *complement* of E (denoted by $E^c$) is the set of all points $p \in X$ such that $p \notin E$
8. E is *perfect* if E is closed and every point of E is a limit point of E. i.e. a point is a limit point of E iff $p \in E$.
9. E is *bounded* if there is a real number M and a point $q \in X$ such that $d(p,q) < M \forall p \in E$.
10. E is *dense* in X if every point of X is a limit point of E, or a point of E or both.

*Theorem*

Every neighbourhood is an open set.

*Theorem*

If p is a limit point of a set E, then every neighbourhood of p contains infinitely many point of E.

*Corollary*

A finite point set has no limit points.


[[file:/static/flopen.png]]

*Theorem*

Let $\left{E_\alpha \right}$ be a collection of sets. Then

\[
\left(\bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha \right)^c = \bigcap_\alpha (E_\alpha^c)
\]


*Theorem*

A set is open iff its complement is closed

A set F is closed iff its complement is open.

*Theorem*

1. For any collection of open sets, $\{G_\alpha\}$, $\cup_\alpha G_\alpha$ is open.
2. For any collection of closed sets, $\{F_\alpha\}$, $\cap_\alpha G_\alpha$ is closed.
3. For any finite collection of open sets, $\cap_i G_i$ is open.
4. For any finite collection of closed sets, $\cup_i F_i$ is closed.


*Definition*

If X is a metric space, E is a subset of X and if E' is the set of limit points of E in X, then the *closure* of E is the set $\bar{E} = E \cup E'$.
in
*Theorem*

1. $\bar{E}$ is closed.
2. $E = \bar{E}$ iff E is closed.
3. $\bar{E} \subset F$ for every closed set $F \subset X$ such that $E \subset F$.


*Theorem*
Let E be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above. Let $y = \sup E$, then $y \in \bar{E}$. Hence, $y \in E$ if E is closed.

*Theorem*

Suppose $Y \subset X$. A subset E of Y is open relative to Y iff $E = Y \cap G$ for some open subset G of X.

(???)

** Compact sets

*Definition*

An *open cover* of a set E in a metric space X, we mean a collection of open subsets of X such that $E \subset \cup_\alpha G_\alpha$.

*Definition*

A subset K of of a metric space X is said to be *compact* if every open cover of K contains a subcover. i.e. if $\left\{G_\alpha \right\}$ is an open cover of K, then there are finitely many indices $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$, such that:

\[
K \subset G_{\alpha_1} \cup \ldots \cup G_{\alpha_n}
\]

*Theorem*

Suppose $K \subset Y \subset X$. Then K is compact relative to X iff K is compact relative to Y.


*Theorem*

Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed.

*Theorem*

Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.
*Corollary*: If F is closed and K is compact, then $F \cap K$ is compact.

*Theorem*

If $\{K_\alpha\}$ is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space X such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of $\{\K_alpha\}$ is non-empty, then $\cap K_\alpha$ is nonempty.
*Corollary*: If $\{K_n\}$ is a sequence of nonempty compact sets such that $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$ then $\cap_1^\infty K_n$ is not empty.

*Theorem*
If E is an infinite subset of a compact set K, then E has a limit point in K.

*Theorem*
If $\{I_n\}$ is a sequence of intervals in $R^1$, such that $I_n \supset I_{n+1}$ then $\cap^\infty_1 I_n$ is not empty.

*Theorem*
If $\{I_n\}$ is sequence of k-cells such that $I_n \superset I_{n+1}$, then $\cap^\infty_1 I_n$ is not empty.

*Theorem*
Every k-cell is compact.

*Theorem*
If a set in $R^k$ has one of the following three properties, it has the other two.

1. E is closed and bounded
2. E is compact
3. Every infinite subset of E has a limit point in E.

   (b) and (c) are equivalent in any metric space but (a) does not in general imply (b) and (c).

*Theorem (Weierstrass)*

Every bounded infinite subset of $R^k$ has a limit point in $R^k$.

** Perfect sets

*Theorem*

A nonempty perfect set in $R^k$ is uncountable.

** Connected sets

Two subsets A,B of a metric space X are /seperated/ if $A \cap \bar{B}$ and $\bar{A}\cap B$ are empty. A subset of X is connected if it is not a union of two nonempty seperated sets.

*Theorem*

A subset E of the real line $R^1$ is connected iff it has the following property: If $x,y \in E$, $x < z < y$, then $z \in E$.

* Topological spaces

*Definition*

A topology on a set X is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of X having the following properties.


1. $\emptyset$ and X are in $\mathcal{T}$
2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$
3. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$

If X is a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}$, we say that a subset U of X is an *open set* of X if U belongs to the collection $\mathcal{T}$.


The collection of all subsets of X is called the *discrete topology*. The collection consisting of X and $\emptyset$ only is the *indiscrete/trivial topology*.

Let $\mathcal{T}_f$ be the collection of all subsets U of X such that X-U either is at most countable or is all of X. Then $\mathcal{T}_f$ is the *finite complement topology*.

*Definition*

Suppose that $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ are two topologies. If $\mathcal{T}' \supset \mathcal{T}$, we say $\mathcal{T}'$ is *finer* than $\mathcal{T}$. If it proper contains $\mathcal{T}$, we say strictly finer than $\mathcal{T}$. The reverse is called coarser. $\mathcal{T}$ is comparable with $\mathcal{T}'$ if one is the subset of the other.

** Basis

A *basis* for a topology on X is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of X (called *basis elements*) such that:

1. For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element B containing x. (B is a cover)
2. If x belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing x such that  $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$.

If $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies these conditions, we define the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ as: A subset U of X is said to be open in X if for each $x \in U$, there is a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$. Note each element is an element of $\mathcal{T}$.

*Lemma*

$\mathcal{T}$ equals the collection of all unions of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

*Lemma*

Let X be a topological space. Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of open sets of X such that for each open set U of X and each x in U, there is an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C \subset U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of X. (C make up a cover and open set of X is a superset of some C).

/Proof./ We will show why every element in $\mathcal{T}$ belongs in the topology generated by the basis, $\mathcal{T}'$. Since for $x \in C \subset U$, there exists a union of C which equals U. The converse follows from the previous lemma.


*Lemma (Fineness)*

Let $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}'$ be the bases for topologies $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ respectively on X. Then the following are equivalent.

1. $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$
2. For each $x \in X$, and each basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing $x$, there is a basis element $B' \in \mathcal{B}'$ s.t. $x \in B' \subset B$.


*** Common topologies

| Topology    | Basis               | Symbol         |
|-------------+---------------------+----------------|
| Standard    | (a,b)               | $\mathbb{R}$   |
| Lower-limit | [a,b]               | $\mathbb{R}_l$ |
| K-topology  | (a,b) and (a,b) - K | $\mathbb{R}_K$ |

Note: K is the set of all numbers $1/n$ for each positive integer n.

*Lemma*
Topologies of $\mathbb{R}_l$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are strictly finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but are not comparable with one another.

*** Subbasis

What if you extend the basis to also take finite intersections?

*Definition*

A subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ for a topology on X is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals X. The topology generated by the subbasis is defined to be the collection $\mathcal{T}$ of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$.

** Order topology

*Definition*

Let $X$ be a set with a simple order relation. The collection of all sets of the following types:

1. All open intervals
2. All intervals of the form $[a_0,b]$ where $a_0$ is the smallest element if any
2. All intervals of the form $[a,b_0]$ where $b_0$ is the largest element if any

is the basis for the *order topology* on X.

** Product topology

*Definition*

Let X and Y be topological spaces. The *product topology* on $X \times Y$ is the topology having as basis the collection of all sets of the form $U \times V$, where $U \in X, V \in Y$.

*Theorem*

If $\mathcal{B}$ is the basis for the topology of $X$ and $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis topology of Y, then the collection:


\[
\mathcal{D} = \{B \times C \vert B \in \mathcal{B}, C \in \mathcal{C}\}
\]

is a basis for the topology of $X \times Y$.


We are also interested in a subbasis.

*Theorem*

\[
\mathcal{S} = \{\pi_1^{-1}(U) \vert U \text{ open in } X \} \cup \{\pi_2^{-1}(V) \vert V \text{ open in } Y \}
\]

** Subspace topology

*Definition*

Let X be a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}$. If $Y \subset X$,

\[
\mathcal{T}_Y = \{Y \cap U \vert U \in \mathcal{T}\}
\]

is the *subspace topology* on $Y$. Y is then a *subspace* of X,

*Lemma*

A basis can be derived in a similar form. (replace Y with B).

*Lemma*

If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

*Definition*

A subset Y of X is convex in X if for each pair of points $a < b$ of Y, the entire interval of points of X lies in Y.


*Theorem*

Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology, let Y be a subset of X that is convex in X. Then the order topology on Y, is the same as the topology Y inherits as a subspace of X.


** Closed sets

Defining topological space with closed sets.

*Theorem*

In a topological space,

1. the empty set and the whole set are closed
2. Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed
3. Finite unions of closed sets are closed

*** Closures

*Theorem*

Let A be a subset of the topological space X.
1. Then $x \in \bar{A}$ iff every neighbourhood of x intersects A.
2. If X is given by a basis, $x \in \bar{A}$ iff every basis element containing x intersects A.

** Hausdorff spaces

Usually it is nicer to have one-point sets closed like in euclidean space, as this means that sequences don't converge to multiple values for instance.

*Definition*

A topological space X is a *Hausdorff space*, if for each pair of distinct points in X, there exist neighborhoods of each point that are disjoint.

*Theorem*

Every finite point set in a hausdorff space is closed.

The Hausdorff space condition is stronger than the condition that finite point sets be closed ($T_1$ axiom) but that's fine. But for fun:

*Theorem*

Let X be a space satisfying the $T_1$ axiom. Let A be a subset of X, then the point x is a limit point of A iff every neighbourhood of x contains infinitely many points of A.

Back to hausdorff spaces:

*Theorem*

Every simply ordered set is a Hausdorff space in the order topology. Product and subspaces of hausdorff spaces are hausdorff spaces.
** Continuous functions

*Definition*

A function $f : X \to Y$ is continuous if for each open subset V of Y, the set $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of X.

It also suffices to show that the inverse image of each basis/subbasis element is open.

Other definitions:

*Theorem*

1. For every subset of X, one has $f(\bar{A}) \subset \bar{f}(A)$.
2. For every closed set of B of Y, the set $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in X.
3. For every $x \in X$ and each neighbourhood $V$ of f(x), there is a neighbourhood $U$ of x such that $f(U) \subset V$.

*Definition*

If $f$ is an injective continuous map, and f' is the surjective function by restricting the range of f, f is a topological imbedding if f' is a homeomorphism of X with Z.



*** Homeomorphisms

Let $f : X \to Y$ be a bijection. If both $f$ and its inverse function are continuous, $f$ is called a homeomorphism.
Another way to define it is to say it is a bijective correspondence such that $f(U)$ is open iff U is open.

** Metric topology

*Definition*

The collection of all $\epsilon$-balls $B_d(x,\epsilon)$ is a basis for a topology on X, called the *metric topology*, induced by d.

*Definition (alt)*

A set U is open in the metric topology induced by d iff for each $y \in U$, there is a $\delta > 0$ s.t. $B_d(y,\delta) \subset U$.

*Definition*

A topological space X is *metrizable* if there exists a metric on X that induces the topology of X. A *metric space* is a metrizable space together with a specific metric that gives the topology of X.

*Lemma (Sequence lemma)*

Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $A \subset X$. If there is sequence of points of $A$ converging to $x$, then $x \in \bar{A}$. the converse holds if $X$ is metrizable.


*Theorem*

Let $f : X \to Y$. If the fucntion if is continuous, then for every convergent sequence $x_n \to x$ in X, the sequence $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$. The converse holds if $X$ is metrizable.

*Theorem (Uniform limit theorem)*

Let $f_n : X \to Y$ be a sequence of continuous functions from the topological space $X$ to the metric space $Y$. If $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $f$, then $f$ is continuous.

** Quotient topology

*Definition*

Let X and Y be topological spaces; let $p : X \to Y$ be a surjective map. The map $p$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in Y if and only if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in X.

(like a homeomorphism without being injective)


*Definition*

A subset $C$ of $X$ is saturated (with respect to the surjective map) if $C$ contains every set $p^{-1}({y})$ it intersects. Thus $C$ is saturated if it equals the complete inverse image of a subset of $Y$. To say that $P$ is a quotient map is equivalent to saying that $p$ is continuous and $p$ maps saturated open sets of $X$ of to open sets of $Y$.

A map is an open set if for each open set in its domain, its image is also open, and likewise for closed maps. All open/closed maps are quotient maps.

*Definition*

If X is a space and A is a set and if $p:X\to A$ is a surjective map, there is exactly one topology $\mathcal{T}$ on A relative to which p is a quotient map, which is the *quotient topology* induced by p.

*Definition*

Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $X^*$ be a partition of $X$ into disjoint subsets whose union is $X$. Let $p : X \to X^*$ be the surjective map that carries each point of $X$ to the element of $X^*$ containing it. In the quotient topology induced by $p$, the space $X^*$ is called a *quotient space* of X.

What concepts do quotient maps work well with?

*** Subspaces

*Theorem*

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a quotient map; let A be a subspace of X that is saturated with respect to p.; let $q: A \to p(A)$ be the map obtained by restricting p.

1. If A is either open or closed in X, then q is a quotient map
2. If p is either an open map or a closed map, then q is a quotient map.


*** Composites

Composites of quotient maps are quotient maps.

*** Products

Products of maps do not behave well, and one needs conditions such as local compactness, and that the two maps are open maps.

*** Hausdorff condition

Does not behave well.

For $X^*$ to satisfy the $T_1$ axiom, one requires that each eleemtn of the partition $X^*$ be a closed subset of $X$.


*** Continuous functions

Similar to how we had a criterion for determining when a map into a product space was continuous, we wish to find when a map out of a quotient space is continuous.

*Theorem*

Let $p:X\to Y$ be a quotient map. Let $Z$ be a space and let $g : X \to Z$ be a map that is constant on each set $p^{-1}({y})$ for $y \in Y$. Then $g$ induces a map $f : Y \to Z$ such that $f \circ p = g$. The induced map $f$ is continuous iff g is continuous; f is a quotient map iff g is a quotient map.

*Corollary*

Let $g : X \to Z$ be a surjective continuous map. Let $X*$ be the following collection of subsets of $X$:

\[
X^* = \{g^{-1}(\{z\}) \vert z \in Z\}
\]

Give it the quotient topology.

1. The map g induces a bijective continuous map f, which is a homeomorphism iff g is a quotient map
2. If $Z$ is Hausdorff, so is $X^*$.kk


*** Topological Groups

A *topological group* G is a geoup that is also a topological space satisfying the $T_1$ axiom, such that the map of $G \times G$ into $G$ sending $x x y$ into $x \dot y$ and the map of G into G sending x into 1/x are continuous maps.

* Connectedness and compactness

** Connected spaces

*Definition*

Let $X$ be a topological space. A *seperation* of X is a pair of disjoint nonempty open subsets of X whose union is X. The space is *connected* if there does not exist a seperation of X.

Note that connectedness is a topological property.

Another formulation of connectedness is that a space is connected iff the only subsets that are both open and closed in X are the empty set and X itself.

For a subspace of a topological space, there is another useful formulation.

*Lemma*

If Y is a subspace of X, a seperation of Y is a pair of disjoint nonempty sets A and B whose union is Y. neither of which contains a limit point of the other. The space Y is connected if there exists no seperation of Y.

*** Forming connected spaces from given ones

*Lemma*

If the sets C and D form a seperation of X, and if Y is a connected subspace of X, then Y lies entirely within either C or D.

*Properties:*
1. The union of a collection of connected subspaces of X that have a point in common is connected.
2. Let A be a connected subspace of X. If $A \subset B \subset \bar{A}$, then B is also connected.
3. The image of a connected space under a continuous map is connected.
4. A finite cartesian product of connected spaces is connected.


** Connected subspaces of the real line

A simply ordered set L having more than one element is called a *linear continuum* if the following hold:

1. L has the least upper bound property
2. If $x < y$, there exists $z$ such that $x < z < y$

*Theorem*

If L is a linear continuum in the order topology, then L is connected, and so are intervals and rays in L.

*Corollary*

The real line is connected and so are intervals and rays

*Theorem (Intermediate value theorem)*

Let $f : X \to Y$ be a continuous map, where X is a connected space and Y is an ordered set in the order topology. If a and b are two points of X and if r is a point of Y lying between f(a) and f(b), then there exists a point c of X such that f(c) = r.

** Path connectedness

*Definition*

Given points x and y of the space X, a *path* in X from x to y is a continuous map $f : [a,b] \to X$ of some closed interval in the real line into X, such that f(a) = x and f(b) = y. A space X is said to be path connected if every pair of points of X can be joined by a path in X.


Although a path-connected space is connected, the converse may not hold (Such as the ordered square).

** Components and local connectedness

*Definition*

Given X, define an equivalence relation on X by setting $x \tilde y$ if there is a connected subspace of X containing both x and y. The equivalence classes are the components of X.

*Theorem*

The components of X are connected disjoint subspaces of X whose union is X. such that nonempty connected subspace of X intersects only one of them.

*Theorem*

the path components are defined similarly, with an equivalence relation when there is a path from x to y in X.

*Theorem*

The path components of X are path-connected disjoint subpaces of X whose union is X, such that each nonempty path-connected subspace of X intersects only one of them.


*Definition*

A space X is said to be *locally connected at x*, if for every neighbourhood U of x, there is a connected neighborhood V of x contained in U. If X is locally connected at each of its points, it is said simply to be locally connected. Similarly, a space is *locally path connected at x* if for every neighbourhood U of X, there is a path-connected neighborhood V of x contained in U.

*Theorem*

A space X is locally connected iff for every open set U of X, each component of U is open in X.

*Theorem*

A space X is locally path connected iff for every open set U of X, each path component of U is open in X.

*Theorem*

If X is a topological space, each path component of X lies in a component of X. If X is locally path connected, then the components and the path components of X are the same.


** Compact spaces

*Definition*

A space X is *compact* if every open covering A of X contains a finite subcollection that also covers X.

*Theorem*

Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.

*Theorem*

Every compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed

*Lemma*

If Y is a compact subspace of the Hausdorff space X and $x_0$ is not in Y, then there exist disjoint open sets U and V of X containing $x_0$ and Y, respectively.

*Theorem*

The image of a compact space under a continuous map is compact.


*Theorem*

Let $f : X \to Y$ is a bijective continuous function. If X is a compact and Y is Hausdorff, then f is a homeomorphism

Useful for proving a map is a homeomorphism.

*Theorem*

The product of finitely many compact spaces is compact.

*Lemma (The tube lemma)*

Consider the product space $X \times Y$, where Y is compact. If N is an open set of $X \times Y$ containing the slice $x_0 \times Y$ of $X \times Y$, then N contains some tube $W \times Y$ about $x_0 \times Y$, where $W$ is a neighbourhood of $x_0$ in X.
