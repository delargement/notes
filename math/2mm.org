* Normal modes

The potential must not depend on the time derivatives of these of these coordinates. The potential must have a local minimum at the equillibrium point. The potential at this point is zero.

T can be written as the quadratic form.

\[
T = \sum_i \sum_j a_{ij} \dot{q}_i \dot{q}_j = \dot{q}^TA\dot{q}
\]

and likewise for V with q instead of qdot.

1. A and B can be made symmetric.

2. A and B are real and positive definite.

We may use the above equation to write the equation E = T + V.

In the above case:

\begin{aligned}
T & \approx \frac12 M l^2 (\dot{\theta}_1^2 + \frac{1}{4} \dot{\theta}_2^2 + \dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2) + \frac{1}{24}M l^2 \dot{\theta}_2^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{12} M l^2 \dot{q}^T \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 3 \\ 3 & 2 \\\end{pmatrix}\dot{q}
\end{aligned}


\begin{aligned}
V & \approx \frac{1}{4} M l g (2\dot{\theta}_1^2 + \dot{\theta}_2^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{12} M l g q^T \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \\\end{pmatrix}q
\end{aligned}

We may then apply conservation of energy $\dv{t} (T+V) = 0$.

This simplifies* to $A\ddot{q} + Bq = 0$. Solutions of this form satisfy $q = x\cos\omega t$

There will be N values of $\omega$ and these values are (normal || eigen)frequencies. This has non-trivial solutions only if:

\[
\vert B - \omega^2 A \vert = 0
\]

Note that the eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal (except when degeneracy) as A and B are real symmetric matrices.

It is possible to get multiple normal modes by exploiting symmetries and then using the fact that the eigenvectors are orthogonal.
