Permittivity constant

\[
\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \si{F.m^{-1}} = 8.85 \si{pF.m^{-1}}
\]

* Capacitance

\[
q = CV
\]

easured in Farad, C/V
How much charge must be put on the plates to produce a certain p.d. between them


Finding C based on geometrical factors

\[
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

** Capacitors in circuits

In series:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \sum_i \frac{1}{C_i}
\]

Same Q, all V_i add to total p.d.

In parallel:

\[
C_{eq} = \sum_i \frac{1}{C_i}
\]
Same V, all Q_i add to Q
