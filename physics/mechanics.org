* Central forces

Only depends of radius from source. Motion takes place in a plane.

** Effective potential

Since L is conserved, express w as L/mr^2

\[
V_{eff} = \frac{L^2}{2mr^2} + V(r)
\]

the first term on RHS is often called the L barrier. This does not hold if v(r) goes to -infty faster than -1/r^2

\[
F_{eff} = \frac{L^2}{mr^3} - V'(r)
\]

We may use it to find r(t) and theta(t) in terms of t:

\[
\dv{r}{t} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{m}} \sqrt{E - \frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - V(r)}
\]

or r(theta):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{r^2}\dv{r}{\theta}\right)^2 = \frac{2mE}{L^2} - \frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{2mV(r)}{L^2}
\]

** Gravitation

The motion of particles is like (earth-sun model):

\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{m\alpha}{L^2}(1+\epsilon\cos\theta)
\]

where epsilon is eccentricity.

*** Eccentricity and orbits


- Circle (e = 0)
- Ellipse (0 < e < 1)
- Parabola (e = 1)
- Hyperbola (e > 1)
