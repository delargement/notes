\section{Context}


\section{Aim}

We would like to investigate the effectiveness of different speed bumps profiles
(parabolic, trapezoidal and sinusoidal) and for each profile, we will
investigate the optimal height with respect to the size of the vehicle/wheel. We
will quantitatively evaluate their effectiveness by measuring our dependent
variable, ratio of ``velocity loss'' to ``Peak vertical acceleration'', which we would
want to maximise as in our model, we would want a speed bump which can slow down
a speeding car as much as possible, while minimising the discomfort felt by
passengers caused by the increase in vertical acceleration.

Our experiment will seek to simulate a speeding car arriving at a speed bump and
consequently slowing down. A toy car will be released and its gravitational
potential energy will convert to kinetic energy (and heat, sound etc.) as it
rolls down. It will then collide with the speed bump and possibly make it over
the speed bump and continue moving to the right in the diagram until it slows
down and stops due to the work done against the car by friction. The speed bump
will be constructed out of clay, which
