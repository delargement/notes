Permittivity constant

\\[
\epsilon\_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \si{F.m^{-1}} = 8.85 \si{pF.m^{-1}}
\\]


## Capacitance {#capacitance}

\\[
q = CV
\\]

easured in Farad, C/V
How much charge must be put on the plates to produce a certain p.d. between them

Finding C based on geometrical factors

\\[
C = \frac{\epsilon\_0 A}{d}
\\]


### Capacitors in circuits {#capacitors-in-circuits}

In series:

\\[
\frac{1}{C\_{eq}} = \sum\_i \frac{1}{C\_i}
\\]

Same Q, all V\_i add to total p.d.

In parallel:

\\[
C\_{eq} = \sum\_i \frac{1}{C\_i}
\\]
Same V, all Q\_i add to Q
