* Postulates
1. Associated to any isolated physical system is a hilbert space which is completely described by its state vector.
2. The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. i.e. the shrodinger equation

* Hamiltonian formalism
** EL equations

L = T - V

\[
\dv{t}\left(\pdv{L}{\dot x}\right) = \pdv{L}{x}
\]

- Generalised momentum

\[
\pdv{L}{\dot q} = p
\]

- Generalised force

\[
\pdv{L}{q} = \dot{p}
\]


*** Cyclic coordinate

When the Lagrangian does not depend on a coordinate qk:

\[
\pdv{L}{\dot q_k} = C
\]

This is also generalised momentum.

q_k is thus a cyclic coordinate.

*** Energy conservation

\[
\pdv{E}{t} = -\pdv{L}{t}
\]


\[
E = \left(\sum_{i=1}^N \pdv{L}{\dot q_i}\dot{q_i}\right) - L
\]

If L has no time dependence, then E is conserved.

E is indeed total energy when the new coordinate q is not related to the old coordinate x with a time dependence $x = x(q,t)$ or qdot dependence $x = x(q,\dot{q})$.

*** Noether's theorem

For each symmetry of the Lagrangian, there is a conserved quantity.

Let the Lagrangian be invariant to first order in the small number $\epsilon$.

\[
q_i \to q_i + \epsilon K_i(q)
\]

each K_i(q) may be a function of all the q_i and need not be constant.

The quantity:

\[
P(q,\dot{q}) = \sum_i \pdv{L}{\dot q_i}K_i(q)
\]

does not change with time and has the generic name of consered momentum.

Example:

For $L = (m/2)(5\dot{x}^2 - 2\dot{x}\dot{y} + 2\dot{y}^2) + C(2x-y)$, K_x = 1 and K_y = 2:

\[
P = \pdv{L}{\dot{x}}K_x + \pdv{L}{\dot y}K_y = m(3\dot{x} + 3\dot{y})
\]

** Hamiltonian

We may write E as:

\[
E(q,\dot{q}) \equiv \pdv{L(q,\dot{q})}{\dot{q}}\dot{q} - L(q,\dot{q})
\]

and we wish to exchange all  $\dot{q}$ for $p$ in E.

\[
p \equiv \pdv{L}{\dot{q}}
\]

When written in this way, we define it as the Hamiltonian.

\[
H(q,p) \equiv p_i\dot{q_i}(q,p) - L(q,\dot{q}(q,p))
\]

*** Hamiltonian equations

\[
\pdv{H}{p} = \dot{q}
\]

\[
\pdv{H}{q} = -\dot{p}
\]

*** Cyclic coordinates

Same as Lagrange.
if q is cyclic, p is conserved.


Let w(p,q) be some function of the state variables with no explicit dependence on t.

\[
\dot{\omega} = \{\omega,\mathcal{H}\}
\]

where the Poisson brackets (PB) between two variables is:

\[
\left\{\omega,\lambda\right\} = \sum_i \left(\pdv{\omega}{q_i}\pdv{\lambda}{p_i} - \pdv{\omega}{p_i}\pdv{\lambda}{q_i}\right)
\]

**** Poisson bracket Identities

Any variable whose PB with $\mathcal{H}$ vanishes is constant in time.

{a,b} = -{b,a}
{a,b+c} = {a,b} + {a,c}
{a,bc} = {a,b}c + b{a,c}

(similar to commutators)

\[
$\{q_i,q_j\} = \{p_i,p_j\} = 0
\]

\[
\{q_i,p_j\}=\delta_{ij}
\]

as $\partial{q_i}/\partial{q_j} = \delta_{ij}, \partial{q_i}/\partial{p_k}=0$

Hamiltonian equations may be written as:

\begin{align*}
\dot{q_i} = \{q_i,\mathcal{H}\} \\
\dot{p_i} = \{p_i,\mathcal{H}\}
\end{align*}


*** Legendre transform

Say that we wish to 'invert':

\[
\dv{F(x)}{x} = s(x)
\]

by constructing a function G(s) which is the Legendre transform of F(x):

\[
\dv{G(s)}{s} = x(s).
\]

By noting $d(F+G) = s \dd{x} + x \dd{s} = d(sx)$, we may write:

\[
G = sx-F = F'x - F
\].

Or

\[
G(s) = sx(s) - F(x(s))
\]

* Statevectors

Statevector expressed in certain basis.

\[
\ket{\psi} = \ket{ + z}\braket{+ z}{\psi} + \ket{-z}\braket{-z}{\psi} = c_+\ket{+ z} + c_- \ket{-z}
\]

Expectation value: $\langle\Omega\rangle$
Square of uncertainty: $(\Delta \Omega)^2 = \langle\Omega^2\rangle - \langle\Omega\rangle^2$

Two states that differ by an overall phase are the same state.


** Rotation Operators

Rotate anticlockwise about z-axis can be defined as:

\[
\hat{R}(\dd{\phi} \bm{k}) = 1 - \frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{J_z}\dd{\phi}
\]
where $\hat{J_z}$ is a hermitian operator and has |+- z> as an eigenvector with +-hbar/2 as eigenvalues.

\[
\hat{R}(\phi \bm{k}) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\left[1-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{J}_z\left(\frac{\phi}{N}\right)\right]^N
= \exp(-i\hat{J}_z\phi/\hbar)
\]

\[
\hat{R}(\phi \bm{k})\ket{\pm z} = e^{\mp i \phi/2} \ket{\pm z}
\]


Notice that rotating by 360deg causes the state to pick up an overall minus sign.

** Matrix representation

The matrix representation of $\hat{A}$ in basis x is $A_{ij} = \bra{i}\hat{A}\ket{j}$ where i j are the bases of x.

** Passive and active transform

passive: rotating the axes
active: rotating the vector expressed in the same axes.

* Stern-Gerlach

The intrinsic spin angular momentum of a particle, we write

\[
\bm{\mu} = \frac{gq}{2mc}\bm{S}
\]

The force by the magnet equals:

\[
F_z = \mu_B \pdv{B}{z}
\]

where u_b is the bohr magneton

* Angular momentum

In general:

\[
\hat{R}(\phi \bm{n}) = e^{-i \bm{\hat{J}\cdot n} \phi / \hbar}
\]

We can represent 2d rotation in the cartesian plane like this:

\begin{bmatrix}
\bra{x}\hat{R}(\phi \bm{k})\ket{x} & \bra{x}\hat{R}(\phi \bm{k})\ket{y} \\
\bra{y}\hat{R}(\phi \bm{k})\ket{x} & \bra{y}\hat{R}(\phi \bm{k})\ket{y} \\
\end{bmatrix}

which just gives:

\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\
\sin\phi & \cos\phi \\
\end{bmatrix}



Note that rotations and generators don't commute as:

\[
[\hat{J}_x,\hat{J}_y] = i\hbar \hat{J}_z
\]

which holds for cyclic permutations

** Commuting operators

Consider two linear Hermitian operators $\Omega, \Lambda$ which commute.

Suppose only a single state $\ket{\omega}$ that is an eigenstate of $\Omega$ with eigenvalue $\omega$.

Then from the commutativity relation: $\Lambda\ket{\omega}$ is also an eigenstate of operator $\Omega$.
Since we presumed there is only one such state, this shows that $\Lambda\ket{\omega} = \lambda\ket{\omega}$.

We can then label the eigenvector as $\ket{\omega,\lambda}$.


*** Degeneracy

If there is more than one eigenstate of the operator $\Omega$ with eigenvalue $\omega$, we say there is degeneracy.

** Eigenvalues and eigenstates of angular momentum

Although the generators of rotations about different axes do not commute, the following operator commutes with each of the gneerators.

\[
\bm{\hat{J}}^2 = \hat{J}_x^2 + \hat{J}_y^2 + \hat{J}_z^2
\]


Since it commutes with each generator, these operators have simulataneous eigenstates in common.

\[
\bm{\hat{J}}^2\ket{\lambda,m} = \lambda \hbar^2 \ket{\lambda,m}
\]

\[
\hat{J}_z\ket{\lambda,m} = m \hbar \ket{\lambda,m}
\]

* 1D problems

\[
i \hbar\ket{\dot{\psi}} = H\ket{\psi}
\]
